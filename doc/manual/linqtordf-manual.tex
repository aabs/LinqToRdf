This document guides you through the steps needed to write a simple semantic
web application in \cs{}. It covers the tools and systems prerequisites, the
techniques and the expected behavior. All examples are in \cs{}, although
LinqToRdf should work on any .NET language that supports LINQ.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What are the components of a Semantic Web Application?}
Within the context of this document, Semantic Web Application means
''application that uses RDF and related technologies''. That is -- an
application that represents information as a graph structure using RDF. It’s
beyond the scope of this document to explain the whole pyramid of standards and
technologies needed to support the semantic web. Instead I’ll give context
enough for you to know what steps are required to get your Semantic Web
Application working.

LinqToRdf uses the SemWeb.NET framework by Joshua Tauberer, which provides a
platform for working with OWL and \spq{}. It also uses the .NET 3.5 namespace
System.Linq which will be released as part of Visual Studio .NET 2008. The
current version at time of writing is targeted at Visual Studio .NET 2008 beta
2.

\section{Programming with LinqToRdf}
\subsection{What do you need to do semantic web programming with LinqToRdf?}
LinqToRdf requires an IDE that supports the latest version of LINQ, which at
the time of writing is Visual Studio .NET 2008 Beta 2. The 3.5 version of the
.NET framework that comes with beta 2 has a go-live license, so it should not
change substantially prior to release.  Get the latest release, if you haven’t
already, and install it.

\subsection{Where to get LinqToRdf}
You can download the latest release from Google code (latest version at time of
writing is LinqToRdf-0.4.msi) . If you want to use the visual designer in
VS.NET 2008 beta 2, you will also need to download and install
LinqToRdfDesigner-0.4.msi, also available for download from the Google Code
website. Check the linqtordf-discuss discussion forum for announcements of
newer releases.  

\subsection{Installation procedure}
Installation is a simple matter of double clicking the MSI file, and deciding
where to install the assemblies for LinqToRdf. The default location will be in
a LinqTordf-0.x directory under ''c:\\Program Files''. It is recommended that you
stay with that location. Once LinqToRdf is installed, you should then install
LinqToRdfDesigner, which will register the DSL (Domain Specific Language)
add-in to Visual Studio. Note that LinqToRdf and LinqToRdfDesigner will only
work with Visual Studio 2008 and above.  

\subsection{Creating an ontology}
The details of the OWL standard are beyond the scope of this document. The
standards document is found at the W3C . There are various tools available for
creating RDF, and it is important to know that the SemWeb library can
understand the Notation 3 syntax  , which is a human readable (non-XML) variant
of RDF. The examples we’ll be using in the rest of this document use Notation 3
(or N3 for short). If your requirements are modest the LinqToRdf graphical
designer should be sufficient for most tasks. If you need to create more
complex ontologies, or if you need them to be created in OWL, RDF or RDFS
format, then you might want to consider tools such as Protégé.
LinqToRdfDesigner will be covered in a later section. This section shows how
the LinqToRdf framework can be used without any other support.  Let’s start
with a simple ontology for recording MP3 files. The ontology file should have
an extension of n3. Let’s call ours music.n3. First you define the XML
namespaces you will be working with:

\begin{verbatim}
@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\#> .
@prefix daml: <http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil\#> .
@prefix log: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log\#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema\#> .
@prefix owl:  <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl\#> .
@prefix xsdt: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\#>.
@prefix : <http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music\#> .

\end{verbatim}

This imports some of the standard namespaces for OWL, RDF, XML Schema datatypes
and others. It also defines a default namespace to be used for all classes and
properties that are going to be defined in the rest of the document. Now let’s
define some classes:

\begin{verbatim}
:Album a owl:Class.
:Track a owl:Class.
:title rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.
:artistName
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.
:albumName 
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.
:year 
    rdfs:domain :Album;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:integer.
:genreName
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.
:comment 
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.
:isTrackOn 
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  :Album.
:fileLocation 
    rdfs:domain :Track;
    rdfs:range  xsdt:string.

\end{verbatim}

This defines a class Track of type owl:Class. After the class declaration, I
defined some properties on the Track Class (:title, :artistName etc). Because
the prolog section previously defined a default namespace, these declarations
are now in the <http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music\#> namespace.
That’s all that’s required to define our simple ontology. Now we can to create
some data for MP3 files.

Create another file called mp3s.n3 and add the following:
\begin{verbatim}
@prefix ns1: <http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music\#> .
ns1:Track_-861912094 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\#type> ns1:Track ;
    ns1:title "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:artistName "Thomas Laqueur" ;
    ns1:albumName "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:year "2006" ;
    ns1:genreName "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:comment " (C) Copyright 2006, UC Regents" ;
    ns1:fileLocation "C:\\Users\\andrew.matthews\\Music\\hist5_20060829.mp3" .
ns1:Track_-1378138934 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\#type> ns1:Track ;
    ns1:title "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:artistName "Thomas Laqueur" ;
    ns1:albumName "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:year "2006" ;
    ns1:genreName "History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley" ;
    ns1:comment " (C) Copyright 2006, UC Regents" ;
    ns1:fileLocation "C:\\Users\\andrew.matthews\\Music\\hist5_20060831.mp3" .
ns1:Track_583675819 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\#type> ns1:Track ;
    ns1:title "Rory Blyth: The Smartest Man in the World\u0000" ;
    ns1:artistName "Rory Blyth\u0000" ;
    ns1:albumName "Rory Blyth: The Smartest Man in the World\u0000" ;
    ns1:year "2007\u0000" ;
    ns1:genreName "Rory Blyth: The Smartest Man in the World\u0000" ;
    ns1:comment "Einstein couldn't do it again if he lived today. He'd be
      too distracted by the allure of technology, and by all those buttheads
      at Mensa trying to prove how smart they are." ;
    ns1:fileLocation "C:\\Users\\andrew.matthews\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes
      Music\\Podcasts\\Rory Blyth_ The Smartest Man in the Worl\\A Few
      Thoughts on the Subject of Gen.mp3" .

\end{verbatim}

These entries were taken randomly from a list of podcasts that I subscribe to.
In addition, I wrote a program to create them, but you could do it by hand if
you want to. ? I’ll show you in a little while how I created the entries in the
mp3s.n3 file. In mp3s.n3 I defined a namespace called ns1. It refers to what
was the default namespace in music.n3.  That means that references to entities
from the ontology like ‘Track’ will be called ‘ns1:Track’ rather than ‘:Track’
as they were called in music.n3.  It doesn’t matter what you call the prefix
for the namespace, just so long as the URI that it maps to is the same as was
used in the ontology definition file. I called it ns1, because that’s what my
import program wanted to do. The point is that the type ns1:Track in this file
refers to the :Track class defined in music.n3. The triple store that we’ll get
to shortly will be able to make sense of that in order to know that a ns1:Track
has a title, artist etc. It is also able to work out the types of the
properties (which just happens to be ‘string’ for the moment).

That’s it. That’s all there is to creating an ontology. Later on, we’ll get
onto the more complicated task of linking types together using
ObjectProperties, but for now you have an ontology and some data that uses it.

\subsection{Hosting your ontology}
Since the uptake of semantic web technologies has been pretty patchy in the
.NET domain your best bet for industrial strength RDF triple stores will (for
now) lie in the Java domain, and there are various triple store solutions that
can be used. For this guide I shall stick to .NET by using Joshua Tauberer’s
\spq{} enabled HttpHandler for ASP.NET, which is sufficient to demonstrate how
LinqToRdf can connect to a \spq{} compatible triple store. LinqToRdf has been
tested with the Joseki \spq{} interface to Jena, which runs on Java. LinqToRdf
is  platform independent.

To use the HttpHandler as a triple store for music.n3, create an ASP.NET
application in visual studio. Place the following into configuration section of
the web.config of the project:

\begin{verbatim}
<configSections>
    <section name="sparqlSources"
    type="System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler, System,
    Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"/>
</configSections>

\end{verbatim}

Next, add the following to the body of the body of the config file beneath the root:
\begin{verbatim}
<sparqlSources>
    <add key="/[your vdir here]/SparqlQuery.aspx" 
       value="n3:[your path here]\mp3s.n3"/>
</sparqlSources>

\end{verbatim}

The name SparqlQuery.aspx doesn’t matter – it doesn’t exist. You can call it
whatever you want. What this does is link the URL for the file SparqlQuery.aspx
to the \spq{} HttpHandler that we next add to the system.web section of the
web.config:

\begin{verbatim}
<httpHandlers>
   <!-- This line associates the \spq{} Protocol implementation with a path on
   your website. With this, you get a \spq{} server at
   http://yourdomain.com/sparql.  -->
   <add verb="*" path="SparqlQuery.aspx"
   type="SemWeb.Query.SparqlProtocolServerHandler, SemWeb.Sparql" />
</httpHandlers>

\end{verbatim}

This uses the HttpHandler defined in SemWeb to accept \spq{} queries and run
them against the triples defined in mp3s.n3. That’s all that’s needed to turn
your ASP.NET into a semantic web triple store! Yes, it’s that easy. To use the
HttpHandler you give the URL (/[your vdir here]/SparqlQuery.aspx in the example
above) defined above in a TripleStore object that is passed to the RDF context
object. Here’s an example taken from the LinqToRdf test suite.

\begin{verbatim}
TripleStore ts = new TripleStore();
ts.EndpointUri = @"http://localhost/linqtordf/SparqlQuery.aspx";
ts.QueryType = QueryType.RemoteSparqlStore;

\end{verbatim}

the LinqToRdf SparqlQuery object will use this to direct queries via HTTP to
the triple store located at ts.EndpointUri.

\subsection{Linking to the ontology from .NET}

Now we have an ontology defined, and somewhere to host it that understands
\spq{} we can start using LinqToRdf. References to ontologies are defined at
the assembly level to prevent repetition (as was the case in earlier versions
of LinqToRdf). You create an Ontology Attribute for each of the ontologies that
are referenced in the application or ontology. Below is an example from the
SystemScanner reference application.

\begin{verbatim}
[assembly: Ontology(
    BaseUri = "http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/10/"
        +"system-scanner\#",
    Name = "SystemScanner",
    Prefix = "syscan",
    UrlOfOntology =
    "file:///C:/etc/dev/semantic-web/linqtordf/doc/"
        +"Samples/SystemScanner/rdf/sys.n3")]
[assembly: Ontology(
    Prefix = "rdf",
    BaseUri = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-"
        +"generatedNamespaceChar\#",
    Name = "RDF")]
[assembly: Ontology(
    Prefix = "rdfs",
    BaseUri = "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema\#",
    Name = "RDFS")]
[assembly: Ontology(
    Prefix = "xsdt",
    BaseUri = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\#",
    Name = "Data Types")]
[assembly: Ontology(
    Prefix = "fn",
    BaseUri = "http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions\#",
    Name = "XPath Functions")]

\end{verbatim}

Each ontology has a number of named properties that can be set. In the example
above, we have only set all of the properties for the system-scanner ontology
itself. The others are standard namespaces that are well-known to the
underlying components of LinqToRdf. They only require a prefix, BaseUri and
Name property to be set. The Prefix property is a suggestion only to LinqToRdf
of how you want the namespaces to be referenced. If LinqToRdf finds a clash
between prefixes, then it will make a prefix name up instead.

The BaseUri is the fully qualified BaseUri used to form full resource URIs
within the triple store. The Name property is used internally to refer to the
ontology symbolically. The other attribute OwlResource has an OntologyName
property that refers to the name of the ontology defined at the assembly level.
Since the prefix is subject to change without notice, the Name property is used
instead to embed a class, field or property into a specific named ontology.

Next you should create a new class called Track in a file called Track.cs.
We’ll see an easier way to do this later on, but for now we’re going to do it
the hard way.

\begin{verbatim}
using LinqToRdf;
namespace RdfMusic
{
[OwlResource(OntologyName="Music", 
    RelativeUriReference="Track")]
public class Track : OwlInstanceSupertype
{
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="title")]
    public string Title
    {
        get { return title; }
        set { title = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="artistName")]
    public string ArtistName
    {
        get { return artistName; }
        set { artistName = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="albumName")]
    public string AlbumName
    {
        get { return albumName; }
        set { albumName = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="year")]
    public string Year
    {
       	get { return year; }
        set { year = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="genreName")]
    public string GenreName
    {
        get { return genreName; }
        set { genreName = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="comment")]
    public string Comment
    {
        get { return comment; }
        set { comment = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="fileLocation")]
    public string FileLocation
    {
        get { return fileLocation; }
        set { fileLocation = value; }
    }
    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", 
        RelativeUriReference="rating")]
    public int Rating
    {
        get { return rating; }
        set { rating = value; }
    }
    private string title;
    private string artistName;
    private string albumName;
    private string year;
    private string genreName;
    private string comment;
    private string fileLocation;
    private int rating;
    
    public Track(TagHandler th, string fileLocation)
    {
        this.fileLocation = fileLocation;
        title = th.Track;
        artistName = th.Artist;
        albumName = th.Album;
        year = th.Year;
        genreName = th.Genere;
        comment = th.Comment;
    }
    public Track()
    {
    }
}

\end{verbatim}

The class is just the same as any other entity class except that the class and
its properties have been annotated with OwlResource attributes . The critical
bit to get right is to use the same URI in OntologyAttribute as we used in
music.n3 and mp3s.n3 for the namespace definitions. Using OntologyAttribute
plus OntologyName allows you to define all attributes as relative URIs which
makes for a much more readable source file. The OwlResourceAttribute defines
our .NET class ‘RdfMusic.Track’ to correspond with the OWL class
http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music\#Track. Likewise the
‘FileLocation’ property defined on it corresponds to the RDF datatype property
http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music\#fileLocation. The Boolean true on
these attributes simply tells LinqToRdf that the URIs are relative. It then
knows enough to be able to work out how to query for the details needed to fill
each of the properties on the class Track.

This approach is deliberately as close as possible to LINQ to SQL. It is hoped
that those who are already familiar with DLINQ (as LINQ to SQL used to be
known) will be able to pick this up and start working with it quickly. In
DLINQ, instead of URIs for resources defined in an ontology, you would find
table and column names. 


That’s all you need to be able to model your ontology classes in .NET. Now we
will move on to the techniques needed to query your RDF triple store.

\subsection{Querying the ontology using \spq{}}

The steps to start making queries are also pretty simple. First just create a
simple LINQ enabled console application called MyRdfTest. Open up Program.cs up
for editing, and add namespace import statements for System.Linq, LinqToRdf and
SemWeb:

\begin{verbatim}
using System;
using LinqToRdf;
using System.Linq;

\end{verbatim}

In Main, create a TripleStore object with the location of the \spq{} server:

\begin{verbatim}
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
    TripleStore ts = new TripleStore();
    ts.EndpointUri = @"http://localhost/linqtordf/SparqlQuery.aspx";
    ts.QueryType = QueryType.RemoteSparqlStore;

\end{verbatim}

TripleStore is used to carry any information needed about the triple store for
later use by the query. In this case I set up an IIS virtual directory on my
local machine called linqtordf, and followed the steps outlined early. The
QueryType just indicates to the query context that we will be using \spq{} over
HTTP. That tells it what types of connections, commands, XML data types and the
query language to use.

Now we’re ready to perform the LINQ query. We’ll get all of the tracks from
2007 that have a genre name of “Rory Blyth: The Smartest Man in the World”.
We’ll create a new anonymous type to store the results in, and we’re only
interested in  the Title and the FileLocation.

\begin{verbatim}
var q = from t in new RDF(ts).ForType<MyTrack>()
    where t.Year == "2007" &&
    t.GenreName == "Rory Blyth: The Smartest Man in the World" 
    select new {t.Title, t.FileLocation};

\end{verbatim}

Then we’ll just iterate over the results and wait for a keypress before quitting.

\begin{verbatim}
foreach(var track in q){
    Console.WriteLine(track.Title + ": " + track.FileLocation);
}
Console.ReadKey();

\end{verbatim}

That’s all there is to it. Of course there’s a lot more going on behind the
scenes, but the beauty of LINQ is that you don’t need to see all of that while
you’re only interested in getting some Tracks back! In the references section
I’ll give some links that you can go to if you want to know what’s going on
under the hood.

\subsection{Using the graphical designer to design an ontology}
The process described in previous sections can be done quite easily using the
LinqToRdfDesigner. This section describes the tasks required to set up a very
simple ontology of two classes called Artifact and Assembly. The program
associated with it is available from the google code site via subversion. It’s
purpose is to gather various bits of information about the running system and
store them as objects in an N3 file for later use. We won’t explore too much of
the application except where it depends on LinqToRdf or LinqToRdfDesigner.

The first task is to create a design surface to draw the domain model on. The
file extension for LinqToRdfDesigner files is ‘rdfx’. Click on the ‘New Item’
button on the standard toolbar.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img3}
\caption{The New Items button.}
\end{figure}

The item templates selection dialog will them appear. You will locate the
LinqToRdf item template at the bottom, under My Templates. If it is not there,
then check that the LinqToRdfDesigner has been installed on your machine.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img4}
\caption{The file templates selection dialog showing the LinqToRdf designer template.}
\end{figure}
 
Change the name of the file to SystemScannerModel.rdfx. This will create
several files in your project.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img5}
\caption{The resulting files using the name that you provide.}
\end{figure}
 
SystemScannerModel.rdfx is the design surface file.
SystemScannerModel.rdfx.entities.tt is a text template file that is used to
generate the C\# file containing the base definitions of you .NET entity model.
SystemScannerModel.rdfx.n3.tt is the text template that is used to generate the
N3 format ontology definition that will be used by LinqToRdf and its
components.

Double click on the rdfx file to open the design surface. You should now notice
that the toolbox contains elements for modeling your classes.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img6}
\caption{the toolbox when you're editing a LinqToRdf design.}
\end{figure}
 
Drag a class from the toolbox onto the design surface.
 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img7}
\caption{the default appearance of a class when first dragged onto a design surface.}
\end{figure}

By default, it will be called something ModelClass1. Rename it to ‘Artifact’.
This class also needs a name within the ontology. In semantic web applications,
classes are named using URIs. You will need to choose a URI for the class.
We’ll get onto that in a moment. For now, press the F4 button an enter
‘Artifact’ in the ‘Owl Class Uri’ property in the property window.

Your properties window should now look like this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img8}
\caption{Editing the properties of a class on the design surface.}
\end{figure}

Right click on the class shape in the designer and click on the ‘Add New Model
Attribute’ menu option.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img9}
\caption{Adding a new model attribute.}
\end{figure}
 
Add an attribute (a field in .NET parlance) to the class and call it
‘ArtifactExists’. Again, use the properties window to set up some properties
for the attribute. Initially it will look like this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img10}
\caption{The default properties of a class property.}
\end{figure}
 
Change the properties to be like this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img11}
\caption{A properly specified attribute has a reference to the property URI
that matches the object or data property in the ontology.}
\end{figure}

What we’re saying here is that the .NET property ‘ArtifactExists’ of .NET type
bool corresponds to the OWL URI ‘artifactExists’ which LinqToRdf will convert
into the XML Schema Datatype ‘xsdt:boolean’. You can ignore the description
property, for the moment, since it’s not currently used in the designer text
templates. Later on we will see how these extra properties can be used within
the text templates to generate documentation for both C\# and N3.

The rest of the attributes attached to the artifact class are shown below.
 
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{images/img12}
\caption{The class with all of the properties defined.}
\end{figure}

Their types should be easy enough to guess, and the OWL URIs are just the same,
except using camel rather than Pascal case, since that is the norm in N3.

Next drag another class from the toolbox onto the design surface and call it
Assembly.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img13}
\caption{two classes related by an inheritance relationship.}
\end{figure}
 
Use the ‘inheritance’ tool from the toolbox to connect from it to the class
‘Artifact’. This will connect the classes using direct inheritance in C\# and
owl:subclass in N3. Your domain model is now taking shape. 

You’re now at a stage where you have something worth converting into code!
Click on the ‘transform all templates’ button on the Solution Explorer toolbar.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{images/img14}
\caption{Invoking the code generator, using the 'transform all templates' button.}
\end{figure}
 
This processes the text templates that were created earlier, supplying them
with the object model that you’ve built up over the last few steps. The output
should look like this.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img16}
\caption{the output from running the code generator.}
\end{figure}
 
If you look inside the code generated for the entities, it should look like this.

\begin{verbatim}
namespace SystemScannerModel
{

    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "$fileinputname$", 
        RelativeUriReference = "Artifact")]
    public partial class Artifact : OwlInstanceSupertype
    {
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "artifactExists")]
        public bool ArtifactExists { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "dateCreated")]
        public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "dateLastModified")]
        public DateTime DateLastModified { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "filePath")]
        public string FilePath { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "isReadOnly")]
        public bool IsReadOnly { get; set; }
    }

    [OwlResource(OntologyName = "$fileinputname$", 
        RelativeUriReference = "assembly")]
    public partial class Assembly : Artifact
    {
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "isSigned")]
        public bool IsSigned { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "strongKey")]
        public string StrongKey { get; set; }
        [OwlResource(OntologyName = "SystemScannerModel ", 
        RelativeUriReference = "version")]
        public string Version { get; set; }
    }
}

\end{verbatim}

Here is an example of a unit test that grabs the data from the assembly.
ArtifactStore is a wrapper around a SemWeb MemoryStthe hierarchy of technologies that are involved in the
semantic webore.

\begin{verbatim}
string loc = @"C:\\etc\\dev\\prototypes\\linqtordf\\"
    +"SystemScanner\\rdf\\sys.artifacts.n3";
ArtifactStore store = new ArtifactStore(loc);
Dictionary<string, AssemblyName> tmpStore = 
    new Dictionary<string, AssemblyName>();
Extensions.Scan(GetType().Assembly.GetName(), tmpStore);
foreach (AssemblyName asmName in tmpStore.Values)
{
    store.Add(new SystemScannerModel.Assembly(asmName.GetAssembly()));
}
Assert.AreEqual(344, store.TripleStore.StatementCount);

\end{verbatim}
 
Before this code will build you need to add a few assembly references to
LinqToRdf, SemWeb and LINQ to your project.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/img15}
\caption{Necessary assembly references for working with LinqToRdf.}
\end{figure}
 
Now rebuild your solution. Assuming there are no other compile time errors in
the system it should build OK. You are now able to perform LinqToRdf queries
against the ontology using the techniques described previously.


REFERENCE MATERIAL






\section{Navigating relationships in LinqToRdf}
The representation and querying of relationships in RDF is very different from
the model employed in relational databases. At first glance, looking at LINQ to
SQL, you might think that that LINQ itself was tied to the relational model,
but that is not the case. LINQ is a fully extensible platform allowing us to represent
other kinds of relationship through the use of query operators.

In LinqToRdf you can use the \verb|HavingSubjectUri| and \verb|HasInstanceUri| to
instruct it to navigate the relationships using \spq{} syntax. here is an
example of \verb|HavingSubjectUri| in action:

\begin{verbatim}
var ctx = new MusicDataContext(@"http://localhost/linqtordf/SparqlQuery.aspx");
var album = (from a in ctx.Albums
              where a.Name.StartsWith("Thomas")
              select a).First();

var tracks = from t in ctx.Tracks
             where t.Album.HavingSubjectUri(album.InstanceUri)
             select t;
\end{verbatim}

Given an object called \verb|album| whose instance URI we already know, we can
select through properties that we know reference that URI. The definition of
property \verb|Album| in class \verb|Track| looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
[OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", RelativeUriReference = "isTrackOn")]
public Album Album
{
    get
    {
	//...
	
\end{verbatim}

The combination of \verb|t|, \verb|Album| and \verb|HavingSubjectUri| is enough
for LinqToRdf to be able to generate \spq{} with a triple like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$t ns1:isTrackOn ns1:Album_2 .
\end{verbatim}

Which will filter all tracks except those that are tracks on \verb|ns1:Album_2|.
To support this, LinqToRdf automatically retrieves and stores the instance URIs
for all ontology classes. If you use projections, then you don't get the
\verb|InstanceUri| property, so you will have to construct your collections
manually.

LinqToRdf also stores a reference to the DataContext from an instance was
retrieved with the instance itself. An instance can therefore define parent
child collections like this:

\begin{verbatim}
private EntitySet<Track> _Tracks = new EntitySet<Track>();

[OwlResource(OntologyName = "Music", RelativeUriReference = "isTrackOn")]
public EntitySet<Track> Tracks
{
    get
    {
        if (_Tracks.HasLoadedOrAssignedValues)
            return _Tracks;
        if (DataContext != null)
        {
	    var ctx = (MusicDataContext)DataContext;
            _Tracks.SetSource(from t in ctx.Tracks 
	    	where t.HavingSubjectUri(this.InstanceUri) 
		select t);
        }
        return _Tracks;
    }
}

\end{verbatim}

This uses the EntitySet container that can be primed with a query based on the
\verb|DataContext| and \verb|InstanceUri| of \verb|this|. It will store the
query and only invoke it on first demand. You need to beware that the
\verb|DataContext| has not gone out of scope before the query gets invoked. That
constraint is in common with LINQ to SQL.
